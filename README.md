# AGITB â€“ Artificial General Intelligence Testbed

This repository contains the official C++ reference implementation of the **Artificial General Intelligence Testbed (AGITB)**, as described in the latest [paper](doc/AGITB.pdf). A corresponding [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04430) preprint is also available, though it may not reflect the most recent updates.

## Thesis

> **The capacity to pass the AGITB constitutes a necessary condition for the existence of Artificial General Intelligence.**

While current generative AI systems often give the impression of intelligence, they lack grounded understanding and therefore cannot be regarded as genuine instances of AGI. To distinguish between surface-level imitation and true general intelligenceâ€”or measurable progress toward itâ€”we require a rigorous, transparent, and actionable benchmark.

## AGITB Goal

AGITB serves as a benchmark for evaluating artificial general intelligence. It consists of thirteen core requirements, twelve of which are implemented as fully automated tests that assess essential characteristics of AGI candidates. Unlike traditional benchmarks centered on symbolic reasoning, language performance, or domain-specific tasks, AGITB evaluates systems at the level of binary signal processing. This low-level design compels models to demonstrate adaptation, prediction, and generalization in ways that cannot be reduced to memorization or large-scale pretraining.

The goal is to advance the **development**, **evaluation**, and **validation** of AGI by offering a biologically inspired low-level testing benchmark.

## C++ Implementation

AGITB is provided as a **header-only** library. Its core abstraction is the templated class `TestBed<Cortex>`, where the user specifies the `Cortex` type to be evaluated. Each `Cortex` instance represents a model under test and, upon receiving an input, is expected to produce a prediction of the subsequent input.

By default, AGITB assumes that `Cortex` objects operate on inputs of type `std::bitset<10>`. If this assumption does not hold, users should add define a custom `Input` type that satisfies the required interface. Conceptually, an `Input` object encodes a binary sample collected from (simulated) sensors or actuators, consisting of ten parallel one-bit channels at a single point in time.

## API Requirements

### `Cortex`
Your Cortex class must:
- Satisfy the `std::regular` concept.
- Provide methods to accept inputs and retrieve predictions using the following interface:
  ```cpp
  Cortex& Cortex::operator << (const Input& p);    // Process input p
  Input Cortex::prediction() const;                // Returns the prediction for the next input
  ```

where `Input` defaults to `std::bitset<10>`.

### Stub Implementation of the Cortex Class for AGI Testbed

```cpp
using Input = std::bitset<10>;
class Cortex
{
public:
    bool operator==(const Cortex& rhs) const { return true; }   // TODO: Full member-wise comparison

    Cortex& operator << (const Input& p) { return *this; }      // TODO: Process input p
    Input prediction() const { return Input{}; }                // TODO: Returns the prediction for the next input
};
```
---


## Usage

To use the AGITB testbed, include the main header file and call the static `run()` method of the `TestBed<Cortex>` class, providing your `Cortex` type as template parameter.

### Example

```cpp
#include "path/to/agitb.h"

int main() {
    using AGITB = sprogar::AGI::TestBed<Cortex>;
    
    AGITB::run();
    return 0;
}
```

## Requirements

To build and run this project, you will need a **C++20-compatible compiler** 

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure your build environment is configured to enable C++20 support  
> (e.g., use `-std=c++20` with `g++` or `clang++`).
