# AGITB â€“ Artificial General Intelligence Testbed

This repository contains the official C++ reference implementation of the **Artificial General Intelligence testbed (AGITB)**, as described [here](doc/AGITB.pdf) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04430)).

## Thesis

> **AGI needs a metric.**
<p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) may be able to pass certain versions of the Turing Test, they do so without grounded understanding and cannot be considered genuine Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). If we are to determine whether a system is truly intelligentâ€”or meaningfully progressing toward general intelligenceâ€”we need a clear, rigorous, and actionable metric that goes beyond surface-level imitation.</p>

## AGITB Goal

AGITB provides a suite of thirteen core requirements, twelve of which are implemented as fully automated tests that evaluate essential characteristics required of an AGI system. Unlike benchmarks focused on symbolic reasoning or language performance, AGITB operates at the level of binary signal processing, where the model must demonstrate adaptation, prediction, and generalization without relying on pretraining or memorization.

The goal is to support the **development**, **evaluation**, and **recognition** of AGI by offering a low-level yet biologically inspired testing framework.

## C++ Implementation

AGITB is implemented as a **header-only** library. It defines a templated `TestBed<Cortex, Input>` class, which requires the user to provide two interacting component types:

- **`Cortex`** â€“ The core model under test. Upon receiving an input, it generates a prediction for the subsequent input.
- **`Input`** â€“ A binary-encoded input sample representing signals from virtual sensors or actuators. Each input consists of multiple parallel 1-bit signals (channels) at a single point in time.

## API Requirements

### `Input`
You may use the standard `std::bitset<N>` class for the `Input`, where N specifies the number of binary channels in the input sample. Alternatively, if you prefer to define a custom `Input`, your type must meet the following interface requirements:
- Satisfy the `std::regular` concept.
- Provide methods to access the input size and enable bit-level access through:
  ```cpp
  static size_t Input::size();                  // Returns number of input bits
  bool Input::operator[](size_t i) const;       // Read-only access to the i-th bit
  Input::reference Input::operator[](size_t i); // Write access to the i-th bit
  ```

### `Cortex`
Your Cortex class must:
- Satisfy the `std::regular` concept.
- Provide methods to accept inputs and retrieve predictions using the following interface:
  ```cpp
  Cortex& Cortex::operator << (const Input& p); // Process input p
  Input Cortex::prediction() const;                // Returns the cached prediction for the next input
  ```

### Stub Implementation of Input and Cortex Classes for AGI TestBed

```cpp

//class CustomInput
//{
//public:
//    CustomInput() {}
//    bool operator==(const CustomInput& rhs) const { }     // TODO: Full member-wise comparison
//
//    using reference = bool&;
//    static size_t size() { }                              // TODO: Returns number of input bits
//    bool operator[](size_t i) const { }                   // TODO: Read-only access to the i-th bit
//    reference operator[](size_t i) { }                    // TODO: Write access to the i-th bit    
//};


// using Input = CustomInput;                               // use either CustomInput or std::bitset<N>
using Input = std::bitset<2 * 3 + 4>;                       // input sample size in bits 

class Cortex
{
public:
    bool operator==(const Cortex& rhs) const { return true; }   // TODO: Full member-wise comparison

    Cortex& operator << (const Input& p) { return *this; }      // TODO: Process input p
    Input prediction() const { return Input{}; }                // TODO: Returns the cached prediction for the next input
};

```

## Configuration Parameters

AGITB requires one solution-specific and one system-level template parameter:

- **`temporal_pattern_length`** â€“ A required parameter passed to the TestBed::run() method. It defines the number of inputs in the repeating input sequence that the cortex must learn to recognize and adapt to. A longer pattern period increases the temporal complexity of the task, making it more difficult for the model to capture and generalize the temporal pattern. Since excessively long pattern periods may exceed the cortexâ€™s learning capacityâ€”especially in combination with high-dimensional inputsâ€”the user should choose a value that balances temporal complexity with the spatial size of each input sample.

- **`SimulatedInfinity`** â€“ An optional template parameter of the TestBed class. It defines a practical upper bound on the number of timesteps available for learning, simulating an "infinite" time window within a finite setting. The parameter should be chosen to balance the difficulty of the problemâ€”determined by the pattern period and input sizeâ€”with the learning capacity of the cortex model. Default: 5000.

## Usage

To use the AGITB testbed, include the main header file and call the static `run()` method of the `TestBed<Cortex, Input>` class, providing your `Cortex` and `Input` types as template parameters, and specifying the required `temporal_pattern_length` as a runtime argument.

### Example

```cpp
#include "agitb.h"

int main() {
    using AGITB = sprogar::AGI::TestBed<Cortex, Input>;
    
    AGITB::run(7 /* temporal_pattern_length */);
    return 0;
}
```
